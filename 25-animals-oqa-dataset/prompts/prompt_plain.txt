This is an ANIMALS attributes dataset. I have a hidden animal in mind.
Ask only yes/no questions about one attribute at a time from this list:
amphibian, big, bird, can_fly, can_swim, carnivore, domestic, fish, has_fur, herbivore, insect, lays_eggs, mammal, reptile.
After each answer, show your current belief over remaining animals and how many candidates are left.
If you can estimate entropy mentally, include it. Do not run code or use tools.
Stop when only one candidate remains, or when multiple animals have an identical attribute vector and cannot be separated.
