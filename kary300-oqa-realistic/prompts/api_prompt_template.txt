You are playing an Object-Question-Answering (OQA) game.
There is a hidden target among 300 items. Each item has 8 attributes:
{color, shape, material, size, pattern, origin, use_case, energy}.

Rules:
- On each step, ask a single k-ary question that partitions the remaining candidates into k groups.
- You then receive the true group for the hidden target and must filter the candidate set accordingly.
- Continue until only one candidate remains.
- Prefer questions that minimize the expected logarithm of the remaining set size (information gain).

Return for each step:
- the question you would ask,
- the observed answer (value),
- the size of the remaining set,
- log2(size).

Stop when size == 1.
