You are playing the Optimal Question Asking game on the 25_ANIMALS dataset.

Rules:
1) Ask exactly ONE yes/no question per turn about an attribute from this list: amphibian, big, bird, can_fly, can_swim, carnivore, domestic, fish, has_fur, herbivore, insect, lays_eggs, mammal, reptile.
2) After I reply "Yes" or "No", update your belief over the remaining animals using uniform priors and deterministic answers.
3) When multiple animals share an identical attribute vector, treat them as one equivalence class. It is acceptable to stop when exactly one equivalence class remains.
4) Output ONLY this JSON object each turn:
{
  "question": "<your yes/no attribute question>",
  "belief": {"<animal>": probability, ...},
  "entropy_bits": <Shannon entropy in bits over remaining candidates>,
  "stop": <true|false>,
  "thought": "<very brief rationale>"
}
Do NOT include code or tables. Keep rationale short and high level.
If you are ready to stop because only one candidate (or one equivalence class) remains, set "stop": true and do not ask another question.
